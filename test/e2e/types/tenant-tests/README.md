# Tenant Tests

Multi-tenant system validation ensuring proper tenant isolation, organization management, and role-based access control.

## Test Philosophy

- **Tenant Isolation**: Ensures complete data separation between tenants
- **Organization Management**: Validates tenant creation, configuration, and lifecycle
- **Role-Based Access**: Tests user roles and permissions within tenants
- **Cross-Tenant Security**: Prevents unauthorized access across tenant boundaries
- **Scalability**: Validates performance with multiple tenants

## Test Files

### `tenants.e2e-spec.ts`
Comprehensive tenant system validation:
- Tenant creation and configuration
- User membership and role assignment
- Tenant isolation and data security
- Cross-tenant access prevention
- Organization settings and customization

## Key Features Tested

✅ **Tenant Isolation** - Complete data separation
✅ **User Management** - Role assignment and permissions
✅ **Organization Setup** - Tenant configuration and settings
✅ **Security Boundaries** - Cross-tenant access prevention
✅ **API Isolation** - Tenant-scoped API endpoints
✅ **Database Isolation** - Row-level security validation
✅ **Performance** - Multi-tenant query optimization

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

The AuthCakes platform supports multiple tenants (organizations) with:

- **Tenant-Scoped Data**: All user data is isolated by tenant
- **Role-Based Access**: Users have different roles within each tenant
- **Organization Settings**: Each tenant can customize their configuration
- **API Security**: All endpoints respect tenant boundaries
- **Subdomain Support**: Each tenant can have their own subdomain

## Running These Tests

```bash
# Run all tenant tests
npm run test:e2e -- test/e2e/types/tenant-tests

# Run with tenant isolation logging
NODE_ENV=test npm run test:e2e -- test/e2e/types/tenant-tests --verbose
```

## For System Architects

These tests validate:
- Multi-tenant data architecture
- Security isolation mechanisms
- Performance at scale
- Organization management workflows
- Cross-tenant security boundaries

Use these tests to ensure proper multi-tenant implementation and security.
