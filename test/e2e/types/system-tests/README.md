# System Tests

System-level validation of infrastructure, performance, and cross-cutting concerns that affect the entire AuthCakes platform.

## Test Philosophy

- **Infrastructure Validation**: Tests system-level components and configurations
- **Performance Testing**: Validates system performance under load
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Tests features that span multiple modules
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Validates logging, metrics, and monitoring
- **Security Systems**: Tests rate limiting, throttling, and abuse prevention

## Test Files

### `throttle.e2e-spec.ts`
Rate limiting and abuse prevention system:
- Request throttling and rate limiting
- IP-based and user-based limits
- Abuse detection and prevention
- Performance under high load
- Error handling for rate-limited requests

## Key Features Tested

✅ **Rate Limiting** - Request throttling and abuse prevention
✅ **Performance** - System performance under load
✅ **Security Systems** - Cross-cutting security features
✅ **Infrastructure** - System-level configurations
✅ **Monitoring** - Logging, metrics, and observability
✅ **Error Handling** - System-level error scenarios
✅ **Load Testing** - Performance validation

## System Components

The AuthCakes platform includes these system-level features:

- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable request throttling
- **Security Headers**: CORS, CSP, and security policies
- **Monitoring**: Request tracking and performance metrics  
- **Caching**: Response caching and optimization
- **Error Handling**: Global exception filters
- **Logging**: Structured logging and audit trails

## Running These Tests

```bash
# Run all system tests
npm run test:e2e -- test/e2e/types/system-tests

# Run with performance monitoring
NODE_ENV=test npm run test:e2e -- test/e2e/types/system-tests --verbose

# Run load testing
npm run test:e2e -- test/e2e/types/system-tests/throttle.e2e-spec.ts
```

## For DevOps & Platform Engineers

These tests validate:
- System performance and scalability
- Infrastructure configuration
- Security policy enforcement
- Monitoring and observability
- Error handling and recovery

Use these tests to ensure platform reliability and performance.
